# *Crypto Arbitrage Analysis*

This is a Python-based analysis of arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin trading between the Bitstampa and Coinbase exchanges.  There were 3 phases to the analysis:  collecting the data, preparing the data, and analyzing the data.  The first half of the analysis compares arbitrage spreads during January 2018 v. March 2018.  The second half focuses on three specific different dates, one in the January, one in February, and one in March.  At the end of the analysis is a summary report with the major conclusions.
